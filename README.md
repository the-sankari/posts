# React Post Update

This web application fetches some posts from db.json file through server api, dislays data in card and updates the publicaiton status by toggle button.

## User Story
+ As a user, I want to toggle the published status between true and false, so I can easily see which posts have been published.
+ As a developer, I want to save these changes to the db.json file, so the updates persist even after refreshing the page.
